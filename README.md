# Module-3-Representing-Data
In this module, you learn some best practices on how to store your data in Matlab.  The choice of how to represent your data should be considered early in your analysis project, as all of the subsequently developed code will depend on it. 

Objectives:
At the end of this module you will be able to:

* Work with  ND arrays, structs, and tables.
* Choose an appropriate variable type for your analysis
* Discuss the pros and cons of choices for data representation in your analysis pipeline

## Materials

1. If you're not familiar with the differences between arrays, strings, structs, and cells, then start by watching the [Data Types](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab/home/week/8) video on Coursera 
1. Read the section on cell arrays, sparse arrays, and structures in the [Elementary Matlab handout](.docs/ElementaryMatlab.pdf).
1. Work through the `representingData.mlx` LiveScript in the docs folder of this repository.
1. Watch this [video on tables](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/introducing-tables-and-categorical-arrays-79924.html?s_tid=srchtitle_tables%20_2) and work through a LiveScript explaiing the use of tables (type `openExample 'CreateAndWorkWithTableExample.mlx'` on the Matlab command prompt).
 
 ## Assignments
 
 - Test your table skills with the [Arrhythmia Table assignment](./docs/arrhytmia.md).
 - Complete the first assignment (Outline a Pipeline) in the Project repository.
