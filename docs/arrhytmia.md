# Arrhytmia

Load the _arrhythmia_ dataset included in MATLAB's Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. 
Reorganize the data into a table - you may have to do some work with the variable name strings to get them into a format appropriate for table variable names. 

Using your data table, perform the following calculations:

1. Compute the ratio of T interval to QRS duration for each individual and store the result in a new column in your table.
2. Find the average QRS duration of females 65 years and older.
3. Use a t-test to determine whether the heights of males and females differ significantly (p < 0.05)


For this assigmen you start from the `arrhytmia.m` starter script in the repository, add your code and then commit and push your solution to create a pull-request that the instructors will review.
